During my time at SLB, I worked on a project that I found pretty meaningful - using NLP to help predict safety hazards before they become actual incidents.

## The Problem

Oil and gas companies generate tons of Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) reports. Like, thousands of them. People report near-misses, incidents, observations - all sorts of stuff. The problem? All that data just sits there. Nobody has time to read through thousands of reports to spot patterns or emerging risks.

We wanted to change that.

## What We Built

The core idea was pretty straightforward: use natural language processing to automatically read through all these HSE reports and figure out which risks we should actually be worried about. Not just based on what happened, but what *could* happen.

We built a system that:
- Reads through incident reports and safety observations
- Groups similar risks together using clustering
- Calculates a risk score based on both how often something happens and how bad it could be
- Sends out notifications to people in specific locations about the top risks they should watch out for

## The Technical Bits

The approach combined a few different techniques:
- Text vectorization to turn reports into something we could work with mathematically
- Dimensionality reduction (because these text vectors get huge)
- Clustering to group similar incidents together
- A custom risk index that weighted both frequency and potential severity

What was interesting was balancing the two factors. A rare but catastrophic risk should rank higher than a common but minor one. But how much higher? That took some iteration to get right.

## The User Side

We also built a simple interface where safety managers could:
- Configure how often they wanted alerts (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Choose how many top risks to include
- Set it up for their specific location

The idea was to make it actually usable, not just a data science demo.

## What I Learned

This project taught me that sometimes the best ML applications aren't the most technically complex - they're the ones that solve a real problem people have. Safety managers didn't need fancy algorithms; they needed a way to not miss important patterns in their data.

Also, working with domain experts (in this case, HSE professionals) made the system way better. They knew which types of incidents were actually concerning versus which ones just sounded scary.
