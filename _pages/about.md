# Hey there! 👋

I'm Abhijeet, and I work as a Sr. Data Scientist at Target. I spend my days building ML systems and figuring out how to make data actually useful for people. 

## What I've Been Up To

Right now at Target, I'm working on some interesting problems around data insights, simulation models and prioritiazation systems. Before this, I was at 73 Strings building LLM-powered platforms, and before I was at SLB doing data engineering and analytics. Each place taught me something different about how data and ML work in the real world.

## Background

I did my undergrad and master's at IIT Madras in Electrical Engineering. My thesis was on reinforcement learning - specifically option discovery methods - which was basically trying to figure out how agents can learn to break down complex tasks. 

## What I'm Into

These days I'm interested in:
- Making LLMs actually useful for real problems 
- Reinforcement learning (still find it fascinating)
- Building things end-to-end - from data pipelines to deployment

I also like tinkering with full-stack development. Being able to build a complete product yourself is pretty satisfying.

## Get In Touch

Always happy to chat about ML, data engineering, or anything tech-related. You can find me at:
